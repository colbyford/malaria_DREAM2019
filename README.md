The Malaria DREAM Challenge is open to anyone interested in contributing to the development of computational models that address important problems in advancing the fight against malaria. The overall goal of the first Malaria DREAM Challenge is to predict Artemisinin (Art) drug resistance level of a test set of malaria parasites using their in vitro transcription data and a training set consisting of published in vivo and unpublished in vitro transcriptomes. The in vivo dataset consists of ~1000 transcription samples from various geographic locations covering a wide range of life cycles and resistance levels, with other accompanying data such as patient age, geographic location, Art combination therapy used, etc [Mok et al (2015) Science]. The in vitro transcription dataset consists of 55 isolates, with transcription collected at two timepoints (6 and 24 hours post-invasion), in the absence or presence of an Art perturbation, for two biological replicates using a custom microarray at the Ferdig lab. Using these transcription datasets, participants will be asked to predict three different resistance states of a subset of the 55 in vitro isolate samples; 

## Subchallenge 1
__Topic:__ Predict the Artemisinin (Art) IC50 (drug concentration at which 50% of parasites die) of malaria isolates using in vitro transcriptomics data.

## Subchallenge 2
__Topic:__ Utilizing a previously published in vivo transcription data set from [Mok et al,. Science 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25502316), predict the resistance status of malaria isolates utilizing in vitro transcription data.
